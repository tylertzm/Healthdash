# Health Dashboard

This Dash web application generates a health dashboard with various statistics and patient details. It visualizes general statistics, patient-specific information, and lab results using interactive graphs and dropdown selection.

## Features

- **General Statistics:**
  - Displays total patients and distribution of illnesses using bar and pie charts.
- **Patient Details and Lab Results:**
  - Allows selection of individual patients from a dropdown menu.
  - Shows identification information, medical conditions, medication list, treatment records, progress notes, immunization records, and consent forms for the selected patient.
  - Visualizes lab results with a bar chart.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Dash
- Plotly
- Pandas

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure your data is stored in a CSV file (`data.csv`) with columns for patient details (name, date of birth, conditions, medications, treatments, progress notes, vaccines, consents).
   - Replace the sample data in the script with your actual data or modify the data retrieval logic accordingly.

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the script to launch the Dash app.
   - Access the dashboard in your web browser at the provided local address (typically `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`).

3. **Interact with the Dashboard**:
   - Explore general statistics and patient details by navigating through the dashboard.
   - Use the dropdown menu to select specific patients and view their detailed information and lab results.

## Customization

- **Styling**: Modify the styles dictionary (`styles`) to customize the appearance of the dashboard components.
- **Data Handling**: Adjust data loading and processing logic to match your dataset structure and requirements.
- **Graphs**: Update or replace the sample graphs (`total_patients_graph` and `illness_distribution_graph`) and lab results graph (`lab_results_graph`) with relevant data visualization.

## Note

- Ensure your data file (`data.csv`) is accessible and correctly referenced in the script.
- Customize the application according to your specific use case and data requirements.
